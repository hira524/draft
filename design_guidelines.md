# AI Pronunciation Tutor Game - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Child-Focused Educational Gaming

**Selected Approach**: Reference-based design inspired by Duolingo's gamification, Khan Academy Kids' child-friendly interface, and PBS Kids' engaging visual language. This educational voice game requires an encouraging, playful aesthetic that maintains children's attention while providing clear feedback.

**Core Principles**:
- Playful Learning: Every interaction feels like play, not work
- Clear Feedback: Visual states are immediately understandable by young children
- Confidence Building: Design celebrates progress and encourages retry
- Distraction-Free: Focus maintained on the speaking/listening activity

- Playful but not distracting (duration: 200-400ms)
- Use ease-out for appearing elements
- Use ease-in-out for state changes
- Spring animations for success celebrations

**Key Animations**:
1. Word transition: Current word scale-out + fade, new word scale-in + fade (500ms)
2. Microphone pulse: Continuous scale 1.0 to 1.15 while listening (1s ease-in-out loop)
3. AI speaking indicator: Gentle wave or bounce (800ms ease-in-out loop)
4. Points increment: Number count-up with scale bounce (600ms)
5. Confetti: Burst from center on success (1.5s duration)

**Minimal Use**:
- No background animations or moving patterns
- No auto-playing decorative animations
- Focus animations only on state changes and feedback
